Module 5 Challenge - Pymaceuticals

Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specialises in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumours received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Observations:

A duplicate was dropped upon cleaning the data for analysis, thus, there are a total of 248 mice that were tested using various drug treatment for this clinical trial. 
Calculating the average size of tumour against the treatment, it shows Capomulin, Ceftamine, Infubinol and Ramicane are the top 4 drugs that has the lowest average of tumour volume. 
The bar graph shows the comparison of drug regimen used by the total number of mice. It shows that Capomulin and Ramicane (>200) are the top mostly-used regimen while Propiva (<150) is the least used during the period of study.
The pie chart shows an almost equal distribution of animal sexes used in the trial. It shows that there are 51% Males and 49% Females. 

Additionally, the boxplot of Final Tumour Volume and Drug Regimen shows that there is an outlier (>35 (mm3)) in Infubinol treatment.

For the Pymaceutical drug of Interest: Capomulin, there is a positive correlation (r=0.84) between the weight and the treatment.
